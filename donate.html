    <h2>Support the World Literacy Foundation</h2>
    <p>We want Epistle Literary to be as accessible as possible, so donations will <strong>never</strong> be required for submission. However, we strongly encourage and deeply appreciate anything you can offer. 100% of your donations go towards the World Literacy Foundation in support of their mission to end illiteracy worldwide. Every amount helps—</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$25 USD gives one child a <strong>literacy pack,</strong> which contains a new book, a literacy workbook, stationary, and literacy resources for their entire family.</li>
    <p>A link for donations will be added soon—check back!</p>
