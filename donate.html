    <h2>Support the World Literacy Foundation</h2>
    <p>We want Epistle Literary to be as accessible as possible, so donations will <strong>never</strong> be required for submission. However, we strongly encourage and deeply appreciate anything you can offer. 100% of your donations go towards the World Literacy Foundation in support of their mission to end illiteracy worldwide. Every amount helps—</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>$25 USD</strong> gives one child a <strong>literacy pack,</strong> which contains a new book, a literacy workbook, stationary, and literacy resources for their entire family.</li>
      <li><strong>$75 USD</strong> goes toward building a <strong>pop-up library</strong> in an underprivileged area so that a child can pick out a new favorite story for free.</li>
      <li><strong>$150 USD</strong> could help <strong>train a teacher</strong> in the unique skills necessary for promoting literacy in an off-the-grid classroom. If you're like us, you believe in the power that a single educator has to create change—help us empower one!</li>
    </ul>
