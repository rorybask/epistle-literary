      <h2>Theme & Mission</h2>
      <p><strong>Epistle Literary Magazine</strong> is a love letter to educators everywhere. We publish writing that honors and appreciates the impact made on you by an educator or mentor in your life. We chose this as the focus of our magazine because educators are often the unsung heroes of our society and the linchpins of literacy efforts, and can shape us in so many ways that deserve to be appreciated.</p>

      <h2>Partnership & Impact</h2>
      </p>Our magazine is about art, but it's also about action. <strong>Epistle Literary Magazine</strong> was created as a <strong>Youth Ambassador fundraising project</strong> for the <a href="https://worldliteracyfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>World Literacy Foundation</strong></a>, a global nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring access to literacy skills and books for children everywhere. This means that your engagement and support not only celebrates the tireless work of teachers and the creativity of lifelong students, every dollar also goes straight to the World Literacy Foundation to make a difference. Your funds are giving literacy packs to students and training to the next generation of teachers tackling the cycle of illiteracy in underprivileged areas. </p>
